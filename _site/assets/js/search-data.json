If none of these work, and still return the same kernel panic, and you have recently performed a major upgrade, you will have to do something more complicated. This requires: . | Another install of Mac OS X on another virtual machine that can boot | The hard drive of the virtual machine that fails to work to be in a format that can be recognised by VirtualBox/whatever other software | . To fix it, follow these steps: . | In VirtualBox, go to the other virtual machine with a working Mac OS X install, and open Settings for that machine. | On the Storage tab, add another hard disk by pressing the little hard drive icon next to Controller: SATA | . | Choose the disk image of the non-working virtual machine, and hit OK | . | Start the virtual machine, and boot into Mac OS X. | With the new hard drive attached, you should have your other hard disk on the desktop, double click it to open Finder. | Navigate to /System/Library/Extensions and delete the two files with AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement.kext | Shut down Mac OS X, detach the hard drive and attempt to boot the non-working virtual machine again. | You should be able to reboot into Mac OS X now! | .

In macOS, there are a lot of reasons a kernel panic might occur. Sometimes, it may just be a one-off when the system crashes unpronounced, or something in the computer is failing. ",
