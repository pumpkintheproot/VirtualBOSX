# Downloading VirtualBox
#### Making sure users get the latest version

<br>
To get started with VirtualBOSX, you'll obviously need to download VirtualBox from the website. It's pretty simple. As of writing, the latest version is 7.0.20. 

```bash
https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.20/VirtualBox-7.0.20-163906-Win.exe
```

This hopefully shouldn't take long. Afterwards, just click the file and you'll launch the VirtualBox installer.

Very simple. Just keep clicking Next until the installer starts (and finishes), that was so easy, wasn't it?

<h2 align="center">If that was easy enough, you can now go to the <a href="01-VBIntroduce">Introducing VirtualBox</a> section</h2>
