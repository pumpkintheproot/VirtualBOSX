# Learning about Kernel Panics
#### A kernel panic, to put it simply, is a safety measure taken by an operating system's kernel (this being Mac OS X) upon detecting an internal fatal error in which either it is unable to safely recover or continuing to run the system would have a higher risk of major data loss..

In macOS, there are a lot of reasons a kernel panic might occur. Sometimes, it may just be a one-off when the system crashes unpronounced, or something in the computer is failing. 

# Kernel Panics in a VM

Obviously, in a Virtual Machine, there aren't really things inside that can go wrong. Normally, when a KP happens inside of one, it normally means the operating system, this being Mac OS X, is dumbfounded by your horrible choices and has no idea what to do next. There are really only a certain number of things that can cause one, and since this is not Apple hardware, it's pretty finnicky to avoid.
